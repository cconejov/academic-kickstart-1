Hello! I am Cesar Conejo Villalobo. I have a major in actuarial sciences from the [University of Costa Rica](http://www.emate.ucr.ac.cr/) and a master's degree in [Statistics for Data Science](https://www.uc3m.es/master/statistics-data-science) at [Carlos III University of Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/home), Spain. Additionally, I have five and a half years of experience in the bank and finance industry. Along this path, I have learned and applied different back-end and front-end data science techniques, especially in data storage infrastructure, efficient computing, data analysis, and prediction algorithms focused on fraud detection using SQL and R.

I am also a history and philosophy lover, a passion I try to mix with data science. The most helpful thing that I have learned from history is that it is not much use to make predictions and calculations in the medium and long term. The world always goes on its own business! In the end, things and situations that are unpredictable or very difficult to occurs can appear, resulting in the analysis being out of date. So, What can we do in this world of chaos? In my case, I consider that the best thing we can do is quantify the uncertainty with probability. =)

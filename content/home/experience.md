  I worked on three fronts:

  * Technical leadership: I provided mentorship and technical support for the data science team tasked with detecting the fraud patterns in credit/debit cards and acquiring business. I also reviewed experiments and assisted in the predictions models for other areas of the bank as the Compliance and Credit departments.

  * Information quality: I conducted activities related to ensuring data quality and consistency. I designed interactive dashboards for showing the evolution of the main KPIs and proactively challenge the presence of anomalies and deviations. Dashboards were used for data-driven decisions of the Business team in order to explain historical and current events related to fraud tendencies and chargebacks.

  * Technological solutions: I was responsible for the migration from structured manual business procedures to automatical systems, especially in the Chargebacks department.

  * Actuarial Analysis: I applied actuarial validation techniques for the pre-feasibility of new insurance policies for acquirer commerce. Also, I estimated the required technical reserves for this new product based on three different actuarial techniques: Chain Ladder, Buhlmann, and Buhlman-Straub. Also, I employed survival analysis in order to determine the life expectancy of the credit/debit cards produced by the bank.

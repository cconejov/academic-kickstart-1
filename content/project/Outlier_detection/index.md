Currently, a lot of processes cause information that can be gathered as time series. Predicting anomalies in the observations also is crucial for decision making. Identifying those events in time series is usually complicated, so packages like _Anomalize_ in R brings effective
solutions for identifying outliers observations.

Work in progress.
